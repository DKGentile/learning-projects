# Learning Projects Playground

This repository contains three non-trivial, language-diverse projects designed to level up systems, backend, and data engineering skills. Each sub-project has its own README with detailed goals, architecture prompts, and stretch ideas.

## Projects

- [`distributed-saga-coordinator`](distributed-saga-coordinator/README.md) (Go): orchestrate multi-step transactions with pluggable dispatchers and observability sinks.
- [`vector-search-service`](vector-search-service/README.md) (Rust): build an approximate nearest-neighbor API on top of an in-memory index with Axum.
- [`temporal-knowledge-extractor`](temporal-knowledge-extractor/README.md) (Python): ingest temporal event streams, assemble a knowledge graph, and surface insights from dynamic relationships.

## Suggested Flow

1. Skim each project README and pick the one that matches the skill you want to sharpen first.
2. Run the provided skeletons, read through the inline TODOs, and outline the missing components.
3. Commit to an iteration plan (whiteboard, doc, or issues) before writing code.
4. Treat each project like a mini capstoneâ€”add tests, automation, and documentation as you go.

Happy hacking! Open an issue in your repo or drop notes alongside commits as you progress so you can track your learning curve.
